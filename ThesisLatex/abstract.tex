Nowadays, the requirements for development speed and software quality are significantly increasing. The use of a flexible architecture and various design techniques certainly can improve the quality of development, but formal quality criteria, such as code metrics, showing the quantitative characteristics of a software system in various dimensions, still remain relevant. In evaluating the duration and complexity of software development, various metrics are used.
Software metrics and their visualization are two important features of   measurement systems. 

The  goal  of  my  thesis  work  is to  analyse  open  source  software  with  RefactorErl,log  the changes of metric value, visualize it and conclude the findings.
