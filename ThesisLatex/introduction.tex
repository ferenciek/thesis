Nowadays, the requirements for development speed and software quality are significantly increasing. The use of a flexible architecture and various design techniques certainly can improve the quality of development, but formal quality criteria, such as code metrics, showing the quantitative characteristics of a software system in various dimensions, still remain relevant. In evaluating the duration and complexity of software development, various metrics are used.
Software metrics and their visualization are two important features of   measurement systems. 

In this thesis, we introduce a module for analysing of quality of programs written in the Erlang programing language. Our goal is to analyse
projects and then prepare the results of the analysis, so it can be added to the RefactorErl static analysis framework for Erlang.
