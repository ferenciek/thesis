  - it would be great to find somebody who can read the thesis and fix
the grammar formulation. I'm not a native speaker, but it seemed to me
that the English could be improved

  - missing spaces: I found places, where the spaces are missing, for
example before parenthesis, or after comma in the abstract.


- citations are insufficient, for example:

     - it is not clear that where the characterization you present in
section 2.1 is defined?


     - what is the source of the classification presented on page 6:
obejctive, subjective?




-2.5 schould be improved, please provide an overview of metrics from the
papers I've sent to you



- 2.5 - OTP used is not a functional metric, it is specific to erlang,

- 3.1 - the description in the variables paragraph does not seem to
belong there



-3.1 - use verb or texttt for code fragments




The bibliography should be unified, sometimes you have full names like
Leo Sartre, but sometimes De.K.P.Yadav.
