My comments:

  - it would be great to find somebody who can read the thesis and fix
the grammar formulation. I'm not a native speaker, but it seemed to me
that the English could be improved

  - missing spaces: I found places, where the spaces are missing, for
example before parenthesis, or after comma in the abstract.

- don't use apostrophe-based abbreviation like: don't, can't ,
project's, it's, we're etc

- check overfull \hboxes in the latex compilation log. That mark the
overfull lines in the text. An example of that is the title of Section 3.3.

- format the code in the text: for example on page 19, the min/1, max/1
are plain text, use texttt or verb.

- citations are insufficient, for example:

     - chapter 1: put citation to RefactorErl and Erlang in the second
paragraph

     - it is not clear that where the characterization you present in
section 2.1 is defined?

     - what is the source of the classification presented on page 6:
obejctive, subjective?

     - have you drawn the figure 2.1, or it is from the web? in latter
case please mark the source in footenote.

     - in 2.3 there is a double quoted part "a reliable..."- you have to
mark the source of this

     - 2.3. Chidamber and ... - cite it

     - 2.3.3 - cite mcabe

     - 2.4 - put citation to all tools, if there is no paper than cite a
documentation or a homepage

-2.5 schould be improved, please provide an overview of metrics from the
papers I've sent to you

- 2.5 - OTP used is not a functional metric, it is specific to erlang,

- 3.1 - the description in the variables paragraph does not seem to
belong there

- 3.1 data types/6 - the opening and closing curly bracket is missing,
type \{...\} in latex

- 3.1 data types/10, delete the "which are the ..." part

-3.1 - use verb or texttt for code fragments

-3.2.1 - the cite 12 is not good for the metric query language, cite
here the metric paper

- 3.3.2 - citation is needed for the used tools and techiques like NVD3,
angualer, DETS

The bibliography should be unified, sometimes you have full names like
Leo Sartre, but sometimes De.K.P.Yadav.
